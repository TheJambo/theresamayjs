# TheresaMayjs

TheresaMay.js is a simple JavaScript framework (why not) that can be quickly deployed in situations where the real Theresa May can't be bothered to show up.

The framework attempts to emulate Mrs May by first disregarding the question, then smashing together a bunch of randomly generated strings around a party line.

The code has been poorly thought though and hastily put together under the influence of alcohol so in that regard it is very much like the Conservative Manifesto. It also contains absolutely no costings.

## License

Commercial licenses for TheresaMay.js are available to purchase. I will be announcing pricing after a systematic consultation with various arbitrary people down the pub, but what I can say is that there will be a cap of £100,000. There has always been a cap. Anyone who says there wasn’t is presiding over a coalition of chaos.


## Usage

Simple. Include TheresaMay.js then create a new instance...

```javascript
var theresaMayBot = new theresaMay();
```

Ask it a question...

```javascript
var response = theresaMayBot.askQuestion("Why do you hate everything that is good and right in the world?")
console.log(response)
```

And get a response back...

> What we have done in government, and what we will continue do in government is to put record levels of funding into leopard print shoes.
